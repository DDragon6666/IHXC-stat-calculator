IMPORTANT - you will need a way of running python for this


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
How to use
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Go to main.py and run the code
You will be able to choose different heroes, stones, artifacts and equipment
After you select those it will print the stats you will normally see in game
You will then be able to put in a specific stat and the stat will be printed
You can also enter all to see all stats or changed to see stats that arent at base value
If you want to change the hero/stone/artifact/equipment, run the code again

How to add heroes
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. To add new heroes go into the calculator folder then heroes.py
2. Scroll down to where it says HERO_STATS = {...}
3. Copy the format of the other heroes with 'hero name': {...}
4. Inside the curly brackets put the class,
   faction etc that is found on the 10* version of the hero
5. Then look at the hero's passive which gives stats,
   if there is +%hp or +%atk or +%armour add 'hp_mult': amount
Notes: Where you add the hero in HERO_STATS doesnt matter, the order of the stats doesnt matter
       If you are using this with my file make sure to remove any - from the name and replace it with a space

How to add artifacts
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. To add new artifacts go into the calculator folder then artifacts.py
2. Go to where it says ARTIFACTS = {...}
3. Copy the format of the other artifacts with 'artifact name': {...}
4. If you want a faction bonus stat/s add 'faction (faction name)': {...}
   with the {...} being any stats like with the rest of the artifact
Notes: Any +atk/hp should be atk/hp: amount, any +%atk/hp should be percent atk/hp: amount
       Where you add the artifact in ARTIFACTS doesnt matter, the order of the stats doesnt matter
       If youre using this with my file make sure to remove any ' fro the name

How to change the guild tech
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. To change the guild tech go into the calculator folder then guild_tech.py
2. Find the list of numbers for the class, e.g. warrior = [60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 20, 20, 20]
3. Change the numbers as you want, the max bonuses are shown above the list
Notes: Make sure that the list have at least 8 numbers in them
       The max values for the numbers (in game) are [60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 20, 20, 20], (bigger numbers will add a bigger buff)

Custom interface - assumes python knowledge
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
If you want to change the interface code you can
To get the hero stats you need to import calculator.stat_finder
You can then go stats = stat_finder.get_stats(hero, artifact, stone, weapon, armour, boots, accesory)
hero is the name of the hero, artifact is the name of the artifact,
stone is an int of where the stone is in the STONES list - found in calculator.stones.py
weapon/armour/boots/accesory are ints, 0 = no equipment, 17 = 6* orange,
18 = class gear of the correct class, 19 = class gear of the wrong class
the function will return a list of stats with it being 'stat name': amount
